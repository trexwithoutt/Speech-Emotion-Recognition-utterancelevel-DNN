# Global Features in SER on IEMOCAP

## Original Aim

Emotions are fundamental for humans, impacting perception and everyday activities
such as communication, learning and decision-making. Recently, SER has been drawing increasing attention. Speech emotion recognition is a very challenging task, since machines do not understand human emotion states, of which extracting effective emotional features is an open question.

In this project, we will explore the several contributions in this area, and find out the significant algorithm doing the emotion detection from speech. We are particularly interested to compare the human-engineered features to the raw representations in human speech. 

## Background

	- Support Vector Machine

	- K Nearest Neighbors
